MAD Clock Recipe/logic layout 


Variables needed: 
Hours, Minutes, Seconds 
Constants Needed: 
Boolean statement (while loop will activate while the statement is true. 
An initial value for real life time, a constant that links hours and a constant that links minutes (research required) 


Loop Logic: 

While bool is true {
Sleep (1) - if its similar to python then this should pause the program for just one second
 Seconds += 1 <this will add one to the second variable 
<seconds to minutes logic>
If seconds >= 60 {
	Minutes += 1
	Seconds = 0 < resetting the seconds to 0, because 60 secs = 1 min 
} 
Else if minutes >= 60{
	hours += 1 
	minutes = 0	<reset minutes to zero after adding one to hours 
}
Print(hours + minutes + seconds) <combine them all to print in a single statement, but make sure to separate each variable with a :.
